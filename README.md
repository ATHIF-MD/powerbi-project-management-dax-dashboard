# ðŸ“Š Power BI Project Management Dashboard with DAX

_An **interactive Power BI dashboard** for tracking and analyzing projects, built with a strong focus on **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**._

This project demonstrates how to transform raw project data into **dynamic KPIs, visual insights, and time-based calculations** using DAX.

## ðŸ›  DAX Measures
This project uses **DAX** to calculate KPIs and time-based metrics.

### ðŸ”¹ DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Budget = SUM(Sheet1[Budget])

Total Hours Spent = SUM(Sheet1[HoursSpent])

Average Budget = AVERAGE(Sheet1[Budget])

Total Projects = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sheet1[ProjectID])
